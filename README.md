This repository has Classes QuickCalculator and InteractiveCalculator, Which both rely on BFCalculator and BigFraction. InteractiveCalculator allows you to input various equations, each term separated by a space, which can be an operator (+,-,*,/), fraction ,or integer. It also includes the command STORE, which allows you to save the last result to a varible(alphabetic char) e.g.(STORE a) or (STORE Z). Capitalization is removed within the program.
QuickCalculator allows for the input of several strings on the command line and returns the solutions to each. each striing should have the same form as an input to the InteractiveCalculator.
